As we can find in the scatter plot:
NYPD and DOT and DPR have the most complaints.
Although the dots diverge when population increases but we can say that the relation between population and volume is linear. 
The slop of the linear regression would be NPYD>DOT>DPR

Another thing is: people outside the NYC will rarely call NYPD and DOT so we donâ€™t have much red or blue dots in the right lower corner.

additional questions:TLC has very small amount of complaints in all zip code but if we plot in a different scale, we might find something about the complains of TLC.
