Principles I used:
0.Use all available space.:
	The empy space in the plot should be filled as much as possible horizontally and vertically.
1.Use visually prominent data elements:
	Connecting lines didn't  obscure points and points didn't obscure each other. 
2.Use proper scale lines and a data rectangle:
	using an appropriate number of tick marks and labels for each axis (3-10 is generally sufficient). 
3.Be careful with reference lines, labels, notes, and keys:
	The data elements should be distinct enough from reference lines, labels, or notes, such that the correlations and trends can still be easily observed.
4.show both the symbols and their connections. The symbols demonstrate the actual concentrations of the data, while the path that the data takes can be better followed using the connections.
