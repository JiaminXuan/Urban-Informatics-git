Principles I used:
1. Use visually prominent data elements:
	Connecting lines should never obscure points and points should not obscure each other. Although there's no multiple samples overlap, a representation is e.g. an alternate color.
2.Use all available space:
	The empy space in the plot should be filled as much as possible horizontally and vertically. 
3.Show both the symbols and their connections. The symbols demonstrate the actual concentrations of the data, while the path that the data takes can be better followed using the connections.
